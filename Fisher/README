Dark Energy Task Force Fisher matrices

In data/ I include some of the Fisher matrices 
calculated by the Dark Energy Task Force (Albrecht06).
These are available in the standalone download of the DETFast software:

Documentation:
I haven't written any, but if there's enough demand I will.
Feel free to contact me with questions and/or comments: coe@caltech.edu

Credits:
The Dark Energy Task Force for providing their Fisher matrices in DETFast.
Jason Dick and Lloyd Knox for answering my questions about DETFast.
Michal Spalinski for testing the Fisher.py installation and providing instructions I'd neglected.
